# teamProfileGenerator

### Description

The teamProfileGenerator is a command line application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays in a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
